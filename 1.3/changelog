Version 1.3 - Oct 12, 2012 22:27

- fixed bug in variables: dx=dx/10 now works | variables are now set to the expr when all variables have been replaced
- changed getPrec to isZero in most iterating functions to make them faster
- removed first trimZeros from floorr and ceilr
- roundr: nprec == 0 now does the same as nprec == undefined
- a = a.replace("-", "") replaced with a = a.substring(1, a.length) and only run when a[0] == "-"
- implemented functions sin and cos so e^(i*pi) now correctly equals -1
- fixed bug: 1.234i now gives correct answer instead of ‘1.,’‘0,234’
- fixed bug: 31i and 234.1i now give correct answer instead of 3i and 324.i
